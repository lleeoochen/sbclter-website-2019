jekyll functions
	"jekyll build" -- takes all files in current working directory [wd] and compiles them to "wd/_site/"
	"jekyll serve" -- locally hosts â€œ[wd]/_site" for viewing at "http://127.0.0.1:4000/
	"jekyll serve -w" -- watches for changes made in working directory, recompiles site whenever changes are made, locally hosts updated site for viewing (see above). Very useful for development.
